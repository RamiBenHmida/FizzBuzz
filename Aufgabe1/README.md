I have developed a C# application for calculatin the FizzBuzz of a given Integer.
The application allows users to enter an Integer to get the Result in a JSon Format.
The Result will be asending from 1 to the given Integer, and only the valid number will be given its result skipping all other numbers.
A valid number is either divisible by 3, 5 or both.
A number divisible by 3 gets Fizz.
A number divisible by 5 Buzz.
A number divisible by 3 and 5 FizzBuzz.

I documented my development steps, providing detailed explanations for the decisions I made along the way.
This documentation serves as a reference for future maintenance and improvement of the application.



## How to Run 

Run the project normally. (or manually in a terminal).
The application will automatically open the swagger server ()`https://localhost:7151/swagger/index.html`).

Press on FizzBuzz/{id}
press on Try it out.

write the input in the field and execute.
The Result will be shown under as a JSon Format.
